# CKAR Survey Database ETL Script

An ETL script written in Python that moves data from Google Sheets to MongoDB with the help of pymongo.

## About
This repository contains an ETL script, that was developed as part of our semester-long project with CKAR CDC (https://ckarcdc.org/), a community development non-profit based in Riverdale Park, Maryland. The main goal of this project was to move all of their survey data from Google Sheets, where the data was collected due to the surveys being administered through Google Forms, to MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database.
